# Intro

Due to the nature of this internship project, learning from previous similar projects could be extremely helpful.

Furthermore, this represents a collection of problem solving concepts and tutorials. 

Throghout the development of my work, I used and cited all of these, even if just for informative reasons.

# Model Development

### GitHub Project Repositories with source code

**[FibrosisNet](https://github.com/darwinai/FibrosisNet)**

 - This open-source project introduces a deep convolutional neural network designed for predicting pulmonary fibrosis progression from chest CT images
 - **`Ideas`**: Use agains my own CNN, if the performance is overwhelmingly superior consider adopting architectural concepts 

### Fine-Tuning and Optimization

 - ImageNet
 - Adam
 - Optuna
 - Early-Stopping

### Ensembles 



### Transfer Learning 

 For feature extraction, we can use transfer learning due to the reduced dataset size, in case we want to use different classifiers (I want to try boosting methods).


### 3d Spacial Dependencies

### Classification vs Segmentation


### Architectural Inspiration


 - **`Comparison_of_CNNs_for_Lung_Biopsy_Images_Classification`** (4 cnns, with different ds sizes as well)
 - **`Lung_Pattern_Classification_for_Interstitial_Lung_Diseases_Using_a_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network`** (new evaluation metric, need to learn about it before using. Uses LeakyReLU and different hyperparameter combinations)
 - **``**

# Dataset Issues

#### Data Normalization

 - HU normalization

#### Image Preprocessing

**[Lung Fibrosis DICOM Image Preprocessing](https://www.kaggle.com/code/digvijayyadav/lung-fibrosis-dicom-image-preprocessing)**

 - Big project (very well documented), developed for a competition, will allow me to learn how to correctly input dicom files for feature extractor training
 - **`Ideas`**: slice plotting, scan gifs, segmentation using Watershed

**[LIDC-IDRI competition playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDd5meH8cStO9cMi98tPT12_)**

 - **`Ideas`**: kickstarter for initial data processing pipeline, as well as architectural concepts
  

#### Small dataset â†’ Data augmentation 

**[Medical image data augmentation: techniques, comparisons and interpretations](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-023-10453-z#Sec17)**

 - Article related to data augmentation options, uses the LIDC-IDRI (and others, pg27 of the pdf) dataset to apply 11 different methods, comparing their performance after classification
 - Uses ResNet to prove effectiveness of said augmentations, allows me to justify choice of augmentation method
 - Includes number of images that result from a single image's augmenttion, very useful for preliminary dataset size analysis
 - **`Ideas`**: method ideas for my dataset, maybe comparing performance difference regarding LIDC-IDRI obtained results (only relative, as in if the best methods are the same for both datasets)

This pdf citation might be useful:

"Optimization has been provided by Adam, and activation has been provided by ReLU. The initial learning rate has been chosen as 0.0003, and cross-entropy loss has been computed to update the weights in the training phase. The number of epochs and mini-batch size have been set as 6 and 10, respectively."

#### Imbalanced Classes



# Results

### Lack of Standardized Metrics for Fibrosis 

 Standard classification metrics (accuracy, AUC) may not fully capture fibrosis progression. Segmentation-based metrics like Dice score, Jaccard index, and Mean Surface Distance (MSD) might be better.

 Reading data augmentatio article might help with that.

### Explainability


### Ethical Concerns

 - Wrong use, unnecessary (false positive) or delayed/ignored (false negative) biopsies, segmentation (where and how much) and classification (has, doesn't) for decision making, regarding both accuracy and benefits for treatment (sometimes seeing that it's there with more accuracy is better than saying where it is with less accuracy)
